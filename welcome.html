<!--but before he standeth still before the conjuror, he singeth many sweet notes.-->
<p>do you believe in death?</p>
<p>death is just the loyal knight of phanes. he is always one with the zephyr and the anxient law of gaia.</p>
<p>i know it's scary sometimes, but avoiding it &nbsp;orever won't do anything.</p>
<br></br>
<p>after all, you can't run &nbsp;rom something that was w&nbsp;thi&nbsp; you from th&nbsp; very beginning.</p>
<br></br>
<p>yours truly,</p>
<p>████████</p>
