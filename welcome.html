<!--but before he standeth still before the conjuror, he singeth many sweet notes.-->
<p>do you believe in death?</p>
<p>death is just the loyal knight of &nbsp;&nbsp;anes. he is always &nbsp;n&nbsp; with the zephyr a&nbsp;d the anxient law of ga&nbsp;a.</p>
<p>i know it's scary sometimes, but avoiding it forever won't do anything.</p>
<p>after all, you can't run from something that was within you from the very beginning.</p>
<p>e&nbsp;cellent work.</p>
<br></br>
<p>yours truly,</p>
<p>███████</p>
