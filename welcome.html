<!--but before he standeth still before the conjuror, he singeth many sweet notes.-->
<p>do you believe in death?</p>
<p>death is just the loyal knight of pha&nbsp;es. he &nbsp;s always one wit&nbsp; the zephyr and the anxient law of ga&nbsp;a.</p>
<p>i know it's scary sometimes, but avoiding it forever won't do anything.</p>
<br></br>
<p>after all, you can't run from someth&nbsp;ng that wa&nbsp; within you from &nbsp;he very beginning.</p>
<br></br>
<p>yours truly,</p>
<p>████████</p>
